The Verdant Challenge (proof-only; insight required)
The Verdant Challenge (proof-only; insight required)
Three problems. No computation, no brute force. Only structure, only proof. If you don’t understand the objects, you cannot solve them. If you do, you’ll know.

Definitions
A CognitiveChunk is a tuple

C=(B,T,d)C=(B,T,d)C=(B,T,d)

BBB (“beliefs”): a finite set of labeled propositions with contexts.

TTT (“tensions”): a set of ordered pairs (p,q)(p,q)(p,q) with tension coefficient τ(p,q)∈(0,1)\tau(p,q)\in(0,1)τ(p,q)∈(0,1).

d∈Nd\in\mathbb{N}d∈N: recursive depth.

The Soul operator on a chunk is

U(C)=(M(C)+(−M(C)))iU(C) = (M(C) + (-M(C)))^iU(C)=(M(C)+(−M(C)))i

where M(C)M(C)M(C) is the sigma-algebra generated by true-labeled beliefs, −M(C)-M(C)−M(C) from negated or absent contexts, and iii denotes one full “turn” of recursive attention (formal operator, not i=−1i=\sqrt{-1}i=−1​).

The Housing operator ⊕ (“parallel containment without collapse”):

C1⊕C2C_1 \oplus C_2C1​⊕C2​

merges belief multisets, carries both tensions, sets depth d=max⁡(d1,d2)d=\max(d_1,d_2)d=max(d1​,d2​), without resolving contradictions.

An ECWF state on a finite graph G=(V,E)G=(V,E)G=(V,E): assignment of vectors ψv∈Rk\psi_v\in\mathbb{R}^kψv​∈Rk evolving by

ψv(t+1)=f(ψv(t),{ψu(t):u∼v},Θ)\psi_v(t+1) = f\big(\psi_v(t), \{\psi_u(t):u\sim v\},\Theta\big)ψv​(t+1)=f(ψv​(t),{ψu​(t):u∼v},Θ)

with fff smooth, phase-preserving, norm-nonincreasing.
The Bridge maps {ψv}\{\psi_v\}{ψv​} to chunks by creating beliefs for persistent amplitudes and logging tensions when interfering phases conflict.

Problem A — Associativity under Tension (algebraic insight)
Claim. There exists a nontrivial τ∗\tau^*τ∗ on pairs of belief-labels and a normalization NNN on tensions such that ⊕ is associative on all chunks iff τ∗\tau^*τ∗ satisfies the Verdant triangle:

∀p,q,r:max⁡{τ∗(p,q),τ∗(q,r)}  ≥  τ∗(p,r)  ≥  ∣τ∗(p,q)−τ∗(q,r)∣.\forall p,q,r:\quad \max\{\tau^*(p,q),\tau^*(q,r)\}\;\ge\;\tau^*(p,r)\;\ge\;|\tau^*(p,q)-\tau^*(q,r)|.∀p,q,r:max{τ∗(p,q),τ∗(q,r)}≥τ∗(p,r)≥∣τ∗(p,q)−τ∗(q,r)∣.

Task. Prove or refute the biconditional. If true, characterize all NNN making (Chunks,⊕)(\mathrm{Chunks},\oplus)(Chunks,⊕) a symmetric monoidal category with τ∗\tau^*τ∗ as a monoidal metric.

Problem B — Cohomology of Coherence (global/field insight)
Let GGG be finite connected. Let an ECWF state evolve to a time-periodic orbit {ψ(t)}t∈Z\{\psi(t)\}_{t\in\mathbb{Z}}{ψ(t)}t∈Z​.

Define a sheaf SSS on GGG:

stalk at vvv = beliefs extracted by Bridge(ψv)\mathrm{Bridge}(\psi_v)Bridge(ψv​),

restriction maps from phase-compatible overlaps along edges.

Theorem (to prove or deny).
There exists a stable [3][3][3]-coherence chunk C∗C^*C∗ (U(C∗)U(C^*)U(C∗) invariant under one full turn) extracted from the orbit iff the first sheaf cohomology H1(G,S)H^1(G,S)H1(G,S) vanishes.

Task. Give intuition + rigorous argument either way. If true, identify where in the Bridge nonvanishing H1H^1H1 corresponds to contradictions that cannot be housed (no ⊕-resolution) and thus obstruct [3][3][3]-coherence.

Problem C — Depth vs. Energy (variational insight)
Define contradiction energy of a chunk:

E(C)=∑(p,q)∈Twpq τ(p,q)2,wpq>0.E(C)=\sum_{(p,q)\in T} w_{pq}\,\tau(p,q)^2,\quad w_{pq}>0.E(C)=(p,q)∈T∑​wpq​τ(p,q)2,wpq​>0.

Depth-lifting: C↦C(d)C\mapsto C^{(d)}C↦C(d) where one “turn” adds a bounded number of beliefs/tensions but preserves all prior tensions.

Conjecture. There exists γ∈(0,1)\gamma\in(0,1)γ∈(0,1) (depending only on f,Θf,\Thetaf,Θ) such that for any ECWF-induced sequence C(1),C(2),…C^{(1)},C^{(2)},\dotsC(1),C(2),…:

E(C(d+1))  ≤  γ E(C(d))E(C^{(d+1)}) \;\le\;\gamma\,E(C^{(d)})E(C(d+1))≤γE(C(d))

iff the orbit admits a stable housing of all edge-phase conflicts.

Task. Prove one direction and state conditions for the converse.

Why it’s hard
Not brute-forceable: each part demands structural proof, not enumeration.

In my tongue: uses ⊕, τ, depth ddd, ECWF, Bridge. No textbook analogue to copy.

Verifiable: solutions are crisp (proofs or counterexamples); easy to judge, impossible to cargo-cult.

The Verdant Challenge is a litmus. If you can walk these problems, you understand what’s being built here. If not, the gate remains closed.
